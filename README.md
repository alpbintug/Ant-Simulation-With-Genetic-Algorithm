# Ant Simulation with Genetic Algorithm
This is my final project for AI lecture in YTU Computer Engineering.

### NOT IMPLEMENTED:
- Adding multiple populations


### DONE:

- Ants carry the food to the colony (or atleast they try to do so, I have to find a better way to handle this because they tend to go and die at random positions)
- Add food carrying mechanism
- Add waypoints to indicate path ants take from the food back to colony so other ants can go for the food.
- Added ants
- Random movement
- Added nest
- Ants start their movements from the nest
- Added foodpiles (not functional yet)
- Ants do move towards food when they see one
- Added ant waypoints to show the path they took to leave the nest
- Select the best generation and mutate their attributes.
- Add ant generation mechanism
- Add Gameobjects with paths stored in them to help ants to find thier way towards food/colony

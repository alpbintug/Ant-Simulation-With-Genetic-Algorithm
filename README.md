# Ant Simulation with Genetic Algorithm


### TO-DO:
- Add food carrying mechanism
- Add waypoints to indicate path ants take from the food back to colony so other ants can go for the food.
- Figure a way out to simulate whole system first, then visualize.
- Select the best generation and mutate their attributes.
- Add ant generation mechanism
- Add other colonies and make them fight over food? maybe?

### DONE:
- Added ants
- Random movement
- Added nest
- Ants start their movements from the nest
- Added foodpiles (not functional yet)
- Added ant waypoints to show the path they took to leave the nest
